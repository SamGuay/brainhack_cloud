Create Policy for group and compartment Go back to Identity and click on Policies. Click “Create Policy”. Name the policy like the group and compartment just created. Description is the github issue link. You can either use the policy builder or switch to manual.

If something is not working, it’s usually a missing policy. One important thing to note is that Policies can ONLY be applied to Groups, NOT Users!\nPolicies for Cloud Shell access A new user can by default not open a Cloud Shell. To provide every user with this permission, we created a Group called “cloudshell-access” and we add every user to this group. The group then as a Policy that allows opening a cloud shell: allow group cloudshell-access to use cloud-shell in tenancy\n","categories":"","description":"This is about Oracle cloud policies.\n","excerpt":"This is about Oracle cloud policies.\n","ref":"/brainhack_cloud/admins/policies/","tags":"","title":"Setting up policies"},{"body":"Overview This section describes how to setup a github action runner on the cloud that you can then use to run huge github workflows that wouldn’t run in the hosted runners :)\nConfigure VM -\u003e Link to VM Tutorial\nConfigure github -\u003e setup custom runner\nConfigure VM-Github connection -\u003e start Runner service\nUse custom runner in Action -\u003e Example QSMxT\n","categories":"","description":"Github action runner\n","excerpt":"Github action runner\n","ref":"/brainhack_cloud/tutorials/gh_runner/","tags":"","title":"Github action runner"},{"body":"Overview Oracle cloud supports High Performance Computing and makes it very easy to setup your own HPC cluster in the cloud\nConfigure HPC cluster -\u003e\nAdvanced: Use MPI networking -\u003e Request HPC resource\n","categories":"","description":"High Performance Computing\n","excerpt":"High Performance Computing\n","ref":"/brainhack_cloud/tutorials/hpc/","tags":"","title":"HPC"},{"body":"Overview The notebook service is like Google Colab, but without the time or resource limitations\nSetup ","categories":"","description":"Notebook service\n","excerpt":"Notebook service\n","ref":"/brainhack_cloud/tutorials/notebooks/","tags":"","title":"Notebooks"},{"body":"Overview Object Storage is like Dropbox, but bigger … it basically allows you to simply store files and they can be accessible via links on the web (or APIs) and you don’t have to monitor the size of the disk (as opposed to block storage) and it comes with very nice features for mirroring your data to other regions or tiering data (making it cheaper to store if files are not accessed very often).\nSetup Preauthenticated URLs Tiering Mirroring ","categories":"","description":"Object Storage\n","excerpt":"Object Storage\n","ref":"/brainhack_cloud/tutorials/objectstorage/","tags":"","title":"Object Storage"},{"body":"Overview Running a Virtual machine on the Oracle cloud.\nSetup Expand disk Login via Cloud shell ","categories":"","description":"Virtual Machine\n","excerpt":"Virtual Machine\n","ref":"/brainhack_cloud/tutorials/vm/","tags":"","title":"Virtual machines"},{"body":"Overview This section describe how the Admin team manages users and projects on the Oracle Cloud.\nFeedback \u0026 Inquiries To ask questions or suggest new features, join the discussion on github.
