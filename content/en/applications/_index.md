  List of Applications. If any of the applications is not available under _Neurodesk_ --> _All applications_ in Neurodesk's start menu (notice that menu entries are sorted alphabetically), you might not be using the latest version of Neurodesktop. Please use the platform-specific documentation page at https://neurodesk.github.io/docs/neurodesktop/getting-started/ to remove the current Neurodesktop ("Stopping neurodesktop" section down the page) and then re-install it ("Quickstart" section at the top of the page).
