  Install neurodesktop on MacOS
---

## Minimum System Requirements
1. At least 3GB free space for neurodesktop base image
2. Docker requirements. Details found under https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/

## Quickstart
### 1. Install Docker
Install Docker from here: https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/ 

### 2. Run Neurodesktop
Create a local folder where the downloaded applications will be stored, e.g. ~/neurodesktop-storage 

1. Open a terminal, and type the folowing command to automatically download the neurodesktop container and run it

```shell
docker run --shm-size=1gb -it --privileged --name neurodesktop -v ~/neurodesktop-storage:/neurodesktop-storage -p 8080:8080 -h neurodesktop-{{< params/neurodesktop/version >}} vnmd/neurodesktop:{{< params/neurodesktop/version >}}
```
<!-- neurodesktop version found in neurodesk.github.io/data/neurodesktop.toml -->

{{< alert >}}
There is a bug in docker 3.3.0 for Mac that makes this command not run correctly and there will be no application menu when you start the desktop. Update your docker version when you see this!
{{< /alert >}}

if you get errors in neurodesktop then check if the ~/neurodesktop-storage directory is writable to all users, otherwise run `chmod a+rwx ~/neurodesktop-storage`

2. Once neurodesktop is downloaded i.e. `guacd[77]: INFO:        Listening on host 127.0.0.1, port 4822` is displayed in terminal, open a browser and go to:
```
http://localhost:8080/#/?username=user&password=password
```

3. neurodesktop is ready to use!
- User is `user`
- Password is `password`

## Deleting neurodesktop:
When done processing your data it is important to stop and remove the container - otherwise the next start or container update will give an error ("... The container name "/neurodesktop" is already in use...")

{{< alert title="Note" >}}
Notice that any data that were saved outside of /neurodesktop-storage would be lost. Please make sure to move all your data to that folder before deleting neurodesktop.
{{< /alert >}}

1. Click on the terminal from which you ran neurodesktop

2. Press control-C

3. Type:
```
docker stop neurodesktop
```
4. Type:
```
docker rm neurodesktop
```

## Using an RDP Client
Startup Neurodesktop using the following command:

```shell
docker run --shm-size=1gb -it --privileged --name neurodesktop -v ~/neurodesktop-storage:/neurodesktop-storage -p 3390:3389 -p 8080:8080 -h neurodesktop-{{< params/neurodesktop/version >}} vnmd/neurodesktop:{{< params/neurodesktop/version >}}
```
{{< alert >}}
If you want to connect via RDP using a different port, replace 3390 in the previous and next step with your port
{{< /alert >}}

Open your RDP client and connect to Computer `localhost:3390`

Use the following details to login if prompted
```
username: user
password: password
```
## Using VNC

To enable VNC and disable RDP, startup Neurodesktop using the following command:

```shell
docker run --shm-size=1gb -it --privileged --name neurodesktop -v ~/neurodesktop-storage:/neurodesktop-storage -e VNC_ENABLE=true -p 8080:8080 -h neurodesktop-{{< params/neurodesktop/version >}} vnmd/neurodesktop:{{< params/neurodesktop/version >}}
```

{{< alert >}}
VNC allows for multiple desktop connections to same instance

Note: Neurodesktop VNC on the browser currently does not support auto-resolution 
{{< /alert >}}

### Using a VNC Client

{{< alert color="warning" >}}
Needs testing
{{< /alert >}}

Startup Neurodesktop using the following command:

```shell
docker run --shm-size=1gb -it --privileged --name neurodesktop -v ~/neurodesktop-storage:/neurodesktop-storage -e VNC_ENABLE=true -p 5901:5901 -p 8080:8080 -h neurodesktop-{{< params/neurodesktop/version >}} vnmd/neurodesktop:{{< params/neurodesktop/version >}}
```

Open a VNC Client and connect to port 5901
