  Install neurodesktop on Windows
---

## Minimum System Requirements
1. At least 3GB free space for neurodesktop base image
2. Docker requirements. Details found under https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/
3. If installing docker using WSL, atleast 20GB space recommended for WSL with Ubuntu

## Quickstart
### 1. Install Docker
Install Docker from here: https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/
{{< alert >}}
The docker installation will reboot your computer a few times and there might be warnings regardings WSL2 and this also might require a few more installation steps that unfortunatley differ for every system. Please get in touch if you are stuck and have a look at our troubleshoot page.
{{< /alert >}}

### 2. Run Neurodesktop
Use one of the following options to run Neurodesktop:

#### Option 1: NeuroDesktop.exe
Download and run the following executable
https://github.com/NeuroDesk/neurodesktop/raw/main/Windows_run_Neurodesk/NeuroDesktop.exe

#### Option 2: Using Terminal
1. Open a terminal (e.g. Powershell), and type the folowing command to automatically download the neurodesktop container and run it

<pre class="language-batch command-line" data-prompt=">">
<code>docker run --shm-size=1gb -it --privileged --name neurodesktop -v C:/neurodesktop-storage:/neurodesktop-storage -p 8080:8080 -h neurodesktop-{{< params/neurodesktop/version >}} vnmd/neurodesktop:{{< params/neurodesktop/version >}}</code>
</pre>

<!-- neurodesktop version found in neurodesk.github.io/data/neurodesktop.toml -->
2. Once neurodesktop is downloaded i.e. `guacd[77]: INFO:        Listening on host 127.0.0.1, port 4822` is displayed in terminal, open a browser and go to:
```
http://localhost:8080/#/?username=user&password=password
```

{{< alert title="Note" >}}
We do not recommend the use of the Firefox browser for accessing Neurodesktop, as this may lead to performance issues.
{{< /alert >}}

3. neurodesktop is ready to use!
- User is `user`
- Password is `password`

## Deleting neurodesktop:
When done processing your data it is important to stop and remove the container - otherwise the next start or container update will give an error ("... The container name "/neurodesktop" is already in use...")

{{< alert title="Note" >}}
Notice that any data that were saved outside of /neurodesktop-storage would be lost. Please make sure to move all your data to that folder before deleting neurodesktop.
{{< /alert >}}

1. Click on the terminal from which you ran neurodesktop

2. Press control-C

3. Type:
```
docker stop neurodesktop
```
4. Type:
```
docker rm neurodesktop
```

## Using an RDP Client
Startup Neurodesktop using the following command:

<pre class="language-batch command-line" data-prompt=">">
<code>docker run --shm-size=1gb -it --privileged --name neurodesktop -v C:/neurodesktop-storage:/neurodesktop-storage -p 3390:3389 -p 8080:8080 -h neurodesktop-{{< params/neurodesktop/version >}} vnmd/neurodesktop:{{< params/neurodesktop/version >}}</code>
</pre>
{{< alert >}}
If you want to connect via RDP using a different port, replace 3390 in the previous and next step with your port
{{< /alert >}}

Open Windows Remote Desktop Connection and connect to Computer `localhost:3390` as shown below.


![win-rdp-1](/neurodesktop/getting-started/win-rdp-1.png 'win-rdp-1')

Resolution and multi-monitor settings can be set from the Display tab.

Once ready, click Connect. This will take you to the following prompt

![win-rdp-1](/neurodesktop/getting-started/win-rdp-2.png 'win-rdp-2')

Use the following details to login
```
Session: Xorg
username: user
password: password
```

## Using VNC

To enable VNC and disable RDP, startup Neurodesktop using the following command:

<pre class="language-batch command-line" data-prompt=">">
<code>docker run --shm-size=1gb -it --privileged --name neurodesktop -v C:/neurodesktop-storage:/neurodesktop-storage -e VNC_ENABLE=true -p 8080:8080 -h neurodesktop-{{< params/neurodesktop/version >}} vnmd/neurodesktop:{{< params/neurodesktop/version >}}</code>
</pre>

{{< alert >}}
VNC allows for multiple desktop connections to same instance

Note: Neurodesktop VNC on the browser currently does not support auto-resolution
