  Neurodesk Docker containers
---

Our containers are automatically built in https://github.com/NeuroDesk/neurocontainers/ and hosted on [dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/orgs/vnmd/repositories) or on [github](https://github.com/NeuroDesk/neurocontainers/packages)

## Pull Docker containers
e.g. for a julia container
docker
```
docker pull vnmd/julia_1.6.1
```

build singularity image from dockerhub
```
singularity build julia_1.6.1.simg docker://vnmd/julia_1.6.1
```

Replace `julia_1.6.1` with your selected application. You can find the available containers here: https://neurodesk.github.io/applications/
